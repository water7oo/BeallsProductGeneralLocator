This Bealls product locator allows associates/supervisors to look up the 3 digit numbers associated with products and find out what departments they belong to.

I created this due to associates and even supervisors struggling to find specific product numbers on the department list/sheet. With this web app you can get the department, subdepartment and hopefully In the future, the location of said product thats in the store by trackign associates location within the store, or displaying the store and showing where the product belongs to in the store.
