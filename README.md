Figured that looking through an entire product department list would be inefficient in finding things, so I created this web app that lets you search the products in the current department listing. This tool can definetly help any new associates figure out where items go during runs on truck day as well. Unfortunately this tool will most likely be formatted for mobile since I wanted it to be accessible as fast as possible when unsure of a product number. 

A small guide will be made in order to prevent any confusion because the goal is to try and make this tool very easy to use and cause minimal frustration. This tool might become obsolete due to the fact that the department listing changes every few months so the product numbers in the code will become invalid. Overall this was still a very fun project to work on and I learned a few things 

**This would be extremely helpful to have as all you'd have to do is scan the department sheet and all the information would automatically sort itself into the code. associates would do this themselves OR have the manager/supervisors of the store remotely update the new department listing and have it go through everyones product locator

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of things that would've been added if I had more time:
A tagging center was also planned to be added that lets associates input the product number and price in order to determine wheather or not something needed a tag or not

A feature that lets you scan the department listing using an API of some sort and 
automatically sort and fill the department listings in the html script OR have the people that send the updated department listings input the document into the product locator and the locator automatically updates the listing 

A tracker that uses the associates physical location to in order to show you where a specific product would go (highly unlikely to happen due to alot of things in the store being moved around and theres no way for me to track that if im no longer working there
