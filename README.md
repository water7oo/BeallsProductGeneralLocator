Figured that looking through an entire product department list would be inefficient in finding things, so I created this web app that lets you search the products in the current department listing. 
Created this tool for both my programming portfolio as well as the fact that this should've definitely been an app for the associates in the store to use.

Since I won't be working at this department store for much longer due to University, I will most likely add a feature that lets you scan the department listing using an API of some sort and 
automatically sort and fill the department listings in the html script.
